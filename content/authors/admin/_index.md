I'm a Technical Director with over 20 years of product and engineering experience who believes that great teams make great products! I can lead your organization from chaotic to controlled without losing its entrepreneurial spirit. I am a lucky husband and father of two (a girl and a boy), living and working from home in Metro Detroit.
